  summary: |
    We acquire U.S.-based SMBs with $5–50M revenue and $1–4M EBITDA/cash flow.
    Priority: B2B, recurring revenue, low customer concentration, defensible niches.
    Consider adjacent opportunities only if clearly commercial (own site, services/products pages)
    and plausibly within SMB scale; otherwise exclude.
  positive_signals:
    - B2B services with contractual or recurring revenue
    - Software or tech-enabled services that are mission-critical
    - Compliance-driven services (safety, testing, regulated)
    - Maintenance/aftermarket/service revenue in durable niches
    - Low cyclicality and diversified customer base
    - Professional services or light manufacturing with defensible niches
  negative_signals:
    - Associations, trade groups, conferences/events, or government programs without clear fee-for-service business lines
    - Venture-style/pre-revenue, or consumer-only trends without defensibility
    - Highly cyclical or seasonal businesses (unless clearly countercyclical)
    - Heavy CapEx/low-margin industries
    - Restaurants, retail boutiques, fast fashion
    - Real estate brokerages, construction-only GCs without recurring contracts
    - Crypto, adult content, gambling
